            Resident Evil 7: Biohazard[a] is a survival horror video game
            developed and published by Capcom,
            released in January 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 (for which it supports the PlayStation
            VR
            headset), Xbox One and in May 2018 for the Nintendo Switch in Japan. The ninth major installment in
            the
            Resident Evil series, Resident Evil 7 diverges from the more action-oriented Resident Evil 5 and
            Resident Evil 6, returning to the franchise's survival horror roots, emphasizing exploration. The
            player
            controls Ethan Winters as he searches for his wife in a derelict plantation occupied by a cannibal
            family, solving puzzles and fighting enemies. It is the first main series game to use a first-person
            view.

            Resident Evil 7 is the first full-length game to use Capcom's in-house RE Engine. The development
            was
            led by Koshi Nakanishi, director of the 2012 Nintendo 3DS game Resident Evil: Revelations. A year
            prior
            to its announcement at E3 2016, it was presented as a virtual reality demo called Kitchen. Resident
            Evil
            7 was considered a return to form for the series; critics praised the gameplay, graphics, and
            design,
            but criticized the boss battles and the final chapter. As of March 2020, the game has sold over 7.5
            million copies worldwide. Two downloadable content scenarios, Not a Hero and End of Zoe, were
            released.
            A sequel, titled Resident Evil Village, is scheduled to be released in 2021.

        gameplay </h3>
    <p>
        The player controls Ethan Winters from a first-person perspective as he searches the
        Baker house for
        his missing wife.[1] Although Ethan is a civilian with few combat skills,[2] he is able
        to arm
        himself with a variety of weapons including handguns, shotguns, flamethrowers,
        explosives and
        chainsaws[3] against the Baker family and a humanoid form of fungus known as the
        "Molded". He can
        block attacks to reduce damage. Various sections of the game are spent being pursued by
        members of
        the Baker family, who, if engaged in combat, can only be temporarily incapacitated.
        However, these
        encounters are avoidable by means of stealth, or running away.[4][5]

        Unlike Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, the gameplay emphasizes horror and
        exploration over
        action.[2][6] The inventory uses a grid-based system with an initial capacity of 12
        slots, but may
        be expanded several times over the course of the game. An item can occupy up to two
        spaces, and four
        items may be assigned to the D-pad. Item boxes found in save rooms may be used to manage
        and store
        items, and can be retrieved from different item boxes for later use.[4][7] Items in the
        inventory
        can be used, examined, or combined with other items to increase their usefulness.[8]
        Many of the
        game's puzzles require that items be examined under certain conditions in order to
        reveal
        secrets.[9] Tape recorders can be used to manually save the game's progress, which,
        depending on the
        given difficulty level, may require the use of a cassette tape.[4][10] Videotapes are
        scattered for
        Ethan to find, which place the player in the perspective of a different character, often
        revealing
        plot information or clues needed to solve a puzzle.[4][11] The PlayStation 4 version is
        playable in
        virtual reality using the PlayStation VR headset

            plot </h4>
        <p>

            In June 2017, Ethan Winters is drawn to a derelict plantation in Dulvey, Louisiana, by a
            message
            from his wife, Mia, who has been presumed dead since going missing in 2014. He finds Mia
            imprisoned
            in the basement of a seemingly abandoned house, but she becomes violent and attacks him,
            forcing him
            to kill her. After receiving a call from a woman named Zoe offering assistance, Ethan is
            attacked by
            a revived Mia, who cuts his hand off. Jack, the patriarch of the Baker family, captures
            Ethan. After
            Zoe reattaches his hand, Ethan is held captive by Jack, his wife Marguerite, their son
            Lucas, and an
            elderly catatonic woman in a wheelchair. Ethan escapes but is pursued around the house
            by
            Jack, who
            has powerful regenerative abilities. In the basement, Ethan discovers reanimated
            monsters
            known as
            Molded. Zoe reveals that she is Jack's daughter, and that the family and Mia are
            infected,
            but can
            be cured with a special serum. Ethan makes his way to an old house to retrieve the serum
            ingredients, kills Marguerite, and has visions of a young girl. Lucas captures Zoe and
            Mia
            and
            forces Ethan to navigate a booby-trapped barn to find them. Ethan chases away Lucas and
            frees Zoe
            and Mia. Zoe develops two serum doses, but they are attacked by Jack, now heavily
            mutated;
            Ethan
            kills him using one of the serums.[4]

            Ethan must choose to cure either Mia or Zoe. Choosing Zoe leaves Mia heartbroken,
            despite
            Ethan's
            promise to send help. As he and Zoe flee on a boat, Zoe reveals that the Bakers were
            infected after
            Mia arrived with a young girl named Eveline when the wreck of a tanker ship washed
            ashore.
            Eveline
            stops their escape by calcifying Zoe, killing her, and Ethan is knocked from the boat by
            a
            creature.
            If Ethan chooses Mia, Zoe gives a bitter farewell to him and Mia. As he and Mia flee on
            a
            boat, they
            come across the crashed tanker, where they are attacked by the creature and knocked from
            the
            boat.
            Mia awakens after she was knocked off the boat and searches the wrecked ship for Ethan
            while
            experiencing visions of Eveline, who refers to Mia as her mother. Eventually, Mia's
            memory
            is
            restored, revealing that she was a covert operative for a corporation that developed
            Eveline
            as a
            bioweapon, codenamed E-001. Mia and agent Alan Droney were to escort Eveline as she was
            transported
            aboard the tanker; Eveline escaped containment, killed Alan, and sank the ship. She
            infected
            Mia in
            an effort to force her to be her mother. Mia finds Ethan and gives him a vial of
            Eveline's
            genetic
            material.[4]

            If Ethan cured Mia, she resists Eveline's control long enough to seal Ethan out of the
            ship;
            if he
            cured Zoe, Mia succumbs to Eveline's control and attacks Ethan, forcing him to kill her.
            Ethan
            discovers a hidden laboratory inside an abandoned salt mine. He learns that Eveline is a
            bio-organic
            weapon capable of infecting people with a psychotropic mold that gives her control over
            her
            victims'
            minds, resulting in insanity, mutation, and superhuman regenerative abilities. Eveline
            grew
            up
            obsessed with having a family, driving her to infect Mia and the Bakers and lure Ethan.
            Lucas was
            immunized against Eveline's control by her creators, The Connections, in exchange for
            providing
            observations on her. Using the lab equipment and Eveline's genetic material, Ethan
            synthesizes a
            toxin to kill her, and proceeds through tunnels that lead back to the Baker house. He
            overcomes
            Eveline's hallucinations, and injects Eveline with the toxin. She reverts to her other
            form,
            the
            elderly woman in a wheelchair; Eveline has been rapidly aging since escaping. Eveline
            mutates into a
            large monster and, aided by the arrival of a military squad led by Chris Redfield, Ethan
            kills her
            with an anti-bioweapon pistol. Chris extracts Ethan (and Mia, if she survived) in a
            helicopter
            branded with the Umbrella Corporation logo.[4]

            Not a Hero
            BSAA agent Chris Redfield teams up with the now reformed Umbrella Corporation, also
            known as
            Blue
            Umbrella, in order to apprehend Lucas Baker and uncover evidence on the mysterious group
            that
            created Eveline, called "The Connections". After rescuing Ethan Winters and sending him
            away
            on a
            helicopter, Chris proceeds into Lucas' lab in the salt mine, where he accidentally runs
            into
            one of
            Lucas' traps and has a bomb attached to his left wrist. Undeterred, Chris continues his
            pursuit. He
            tries to rescue several captured Umbrella soldiers, but they are killed by Lucas' traps.
            Eventually,
            Lucas activates a timer on Chris' bomb. Chris is forced to freeze the bomb in liquid
            nitrogen,
            disabling it long enough for him to remove it.

            With the bomb removed, Chris battles his way through more of Lucas' Molded and traps. He
            then finds
            his way into a secret Connections research lab, where Lucas had killed all of the
            Connections
            researchers and plans to betray the organization. Chris manages to corner and shoot
            Lucas,
            which
            triggers a mutation in his body. Chris battles and eventually kills the mutated Lucas,
            and
            stops him
            from transferring all of his data on Eveline to an unknown party. With his mission done
            and
            Eveline's infection contained, Chris returns to the Umbrella base camp for an urgent
            call.

            End of Zoe
            Following the path in the main game in which Ethan cures Mia instead of Zoe, Zoe wanders
            into the
            swamp and is apparently killed by Eveline; however, a pair of Umbrella soldiers find her
            body and
            discover she is still alive. They are ambushed by Joe Baker, Zoe's uncle, who lives in
            the
            Dulvey
            swamps and has not been affected by Eveline's mold. Joe initially believes Umbrella is
            responsible
            for Zoe's condition, but a surviving Umbrella soldier claims they have a cure for Zoe
            stored
            in a
            nearby shack. Joe goes to the shack, finding a partial cure, and returns to find the
            Umbrella
            soldier killed by a Molded.

            Joe initially flees with Zoe on a boat to find the Umbrella base but is soon forced to
            search for
            the base on foot. A powerful and seemingly unkillable Molded called the "Swamp Man"
            pursues
            them
            along the way. Joe and Zoe find the Umbrella base abandoned. They learn that the cure
            has
            been moved
            to a nearby paddle boat. Joe boards the boat and, after encountering the Swamp Man once
            again,
            uncovers a full dose of the cure. The Swamp Man captures Zoe before Joe can administer
            the
            cure. Joe
            gives chase into a heavily infected portion of the swamp and finds Zoe in an abandoned
            church.
            Inside, Joe is ambushed by the Swamp Man, who is revealed to be a heavily mutated Jack
            Baker. Jack
            knocks Joe unconscious and throws him into the swamp water to die.

            Joe washes up near the Baker mansion and finds himself in the midst of a battle between
            the
            Molded
            and Umbrella forces. He recovers an Umbrella power gauntlet and enters the mansion,
            where he
            successfully kills Jack and administers the cure to Zoe just as Umbrella reinforcements
            arrive,
            including Chris Redfield. Chris assures Joe and Zoe that they are there to help, and Zoe
            is
            fully
            cured of her infection. She then receives a phone call from Ethan, and thanks him for
            keeping his
            promise to send help for her

                development </h5>
            <p>
                Following the release of Resident Evil 6, Capcom conducted internal discussions regarding the
                direction of the next installment. A preliminary version of the game, developed in 2013,
                featured a more action-oriented gameplay, similar to that of Resident Evil 6. Taking inspiration
                from the 1981 film The Evil Dead, the developers decided to scale back the game to one location
                and use a first-person perspective to immerse players and return the series to its roots of
                survival horror.[13][14] Development began around February 2014.[15] The game is built on a
                custom game engine, named the RE Engine, which includes virtual reality (VR) development
                tools.[16] The decision to make the game first-person was made well before VR was
                considered;[12] VR development started in October 2015, for which a separate team was
                created.[17] The introduction of VR demanded that textures be more detailed, discarding flat
                textures and inaccurate object sizes that had previously been used.[18]

                A year before the game's announcement, Capcom presented to attendants of E3 2015 a first-person
                horror-themed VR demo, KI7CHEN, which ran on the same engine.[16][19] While Resident Evil 7 had
                been in development long before, KI7CHEN was seen as an opportunity to evaluate how the RE
                Engine and its VR capabilities would be received.[12] As a hint to the demo's relation to
                Resident Evil 7, the logo of KI7CHEN had the letter "T" designed so that it resembled a "7", but
                it went largely unnoticed.[15] In the company's Integrated Report of 2015, the Resident Evil
                development division of Capcom was stated to focus on creating experiences for the VR market,
                which included the new VR engine and games for the eighth generation of consoles.[20]

                The game was directed by Koshi Nakanishi, who previously helmed Resident Evil: Revelations,
                leading a development team numbering at about 120 staff.[13] For the first time in the series,
                the narrative designer is a westerner—Richard Pearsey, writer of the two expansion packs of
                F.E.A.R. and one of the narrative designers of Spec Ops: The Line.[21] At the time of the game's
                reveal, development was around 65% complete.[15] Some of the creature models in Resident Evil 7
                were first created in physical form – a number of them from actual meat – by make-up artists, to
                then be scanned through the employment of photogrammetry. This technology developed over half of
                the general assets of the game, but posed a problem in researching the setting of Louisiana
                because its considerable demand for equipment made it unviable for transport, which required
                Capcom to model by hand.[22] The game's score was composed by Capcom's lead composer Akiyuki
                Morimoto, Miwako Chinone, and Satoshi Hori, with additional contributions from Cris Velasco and
                Brian D'Oliveira.[23] Its theme song, an arranged version of the traditional American folk song
                "Go Tell Aunt Rhody", was written by Michael A. Levine and performed by Jordan Reyne. Levine's
                step-daughter Mariana Barreto was the original choice, but ended up doing the background vocals.
                The song went through about 20 versions until completion.[24] A soundtrack was released
                digitally by Sumthing Else Music Works alongside the game on January 24.[23]
